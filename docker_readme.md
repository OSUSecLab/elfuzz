# How to Use This ELFuzz Docker Image

This Docker image contains source code, data, and utilities to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper "ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space."

## Source location

In the following instructions, you will work in the directory `/elfuzz/`. However, the actual source location is `/home/appuser/elmfuzz/`.

This file is a symlink to `/home/appuser/elmfuzz/docker_readme.md`. `docs/` is a symlink to `/home/appuser/elmfuzz/docs/`. Files and directories created in the later experiments are mostly symlinks to files or directories in the actual source location. You can use `realpath` to check where they point to.

## Launching and setting up the container

The experiments require [sibling containers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39151188/is-there-a-way-to-start-a-sibling-docker-container-mounting-volumes-from-the-hos). You'll need to run the following command to enable them:

```bash
elfuzz setup
```

You'll need to restart this container manually after the command finishes to make the changes take effect.

Then, you need to download the large binary files from Figshare into the local repository. Run the following command to do so:

```bash
elfuzz download
```

This may take a while, and after it finishes, you will get all you need to run the experiments.

You can use `elfuzz config` to configure settings such as email notifications.

## Experiments

The following sections describe how to reproduce the experiments presented in the paper. Note that we include all intermediate results acquired in our previous experiments, so you can skip any steps that you don't have time or resources to run.

### Synthesizing fuzzers by ELFuzz and its four variants

### Mining grammars by GLADE

### Mining semantic constraints by ISLearn

### Producing and minimizing seed test cases

### Conducting RQ1 experiments

### Conducting RQ2 experiments

### Conducting RQ3 experiments

### Conducting RQ4 experiments

## Result analysis and visualization
