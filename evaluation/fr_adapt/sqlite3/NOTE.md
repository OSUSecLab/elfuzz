# Notes

1. We have to switch the functions listed in `func_fallback_to_steens` to use the Steensgaard algorithm instead of the default Andersen algorithm in pointer analysis otherwise the process will get stuck for more than 2 days at the entry point `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput`.
2. `sqlite3.c` is generated by a tcl script. To inject bugs, you have to remove the sqlite3.c target in the Makefile.
