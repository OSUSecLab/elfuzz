# Config grammar of `systemd-networkd`

This is the config grammar of network files of `systemd-networkd`. It is created according to a simplified description of the config file from the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/systemd-networkd#network_files). A full specification is [available](https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.network.5), but contains 27,000+ words, making it impractical to make a full grammar within the time limit of the research.
