# Python grammar from ANTLR 4

The source is modified from the [ANTLR 4 grammars repository](https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/tree/af3d5f7397685bfead506defe96643d3971abbbd/python/python3). The original grammar will cause errors when being processed by Grammarinator. We slightly modify it to fix the errors.
