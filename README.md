# ELFuzz

[![Artifacts DOI](https://img.shields.io/badge/Artifacts_DOI-10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.29177162-green)](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29177162)

This repository contains the source code of the replication package of the paper "ELFuzz: Efficient Input Generation via LLM-driven Synthesis Over Fuzzer Space."

## Experiment data

The experiment data are published on [Figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29177162).

## Replication package

The code and environment to replicate the experiments are published as a Docker image. Run the following command to pull it:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/cychen2021/elfuzz:25.06.0
```

Instead, if you download the Docker image as a tarball from Figshare, you can import it using the following commands:

```bash
zstd -d "elfuzz_docker_<timetag>.tar.zst"
docker load --input "elfuzz_docker_<timetag>.tar"
```

After pulling/importing the image, run the following command to start the container:

```bash
docker run --storage-opt size=150G --cpus 30 -it --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway -v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock" --name elfuzz ghcr.io/cychen2021/elfuzz:25.06.0
```

Explanation of the command is as follows:

- `--storage-opt size=150G`: Allocates 150 GB of disk space to the container. We need this as some files generated/downloaded during the experiments are large, such as the models pulls from Hugging Face and the seed test cases generated by ELFuzz fuzzers.
- `--cpus 30`: Allocates 30 CPU cores to the container. This is to speed up operations such as minimizing seed test cases via parallelization.
- `-it`: Runs the container in interactive mode with a terminal.
- `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`: Adds a host entry to the container so that it can access the host machine. This is needed for query the LLM served in a [sibling container](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39151188/is-there-a-way-to-start-a-sibling-docker-container-mounting-volumes-from-the-hos).
- `-v "/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock"`: Mounts the Docker socket into the container, allowing it to run sibling containers.
- `--name elfuzz`: Names the container `elfuzz`.
- `ghcr.io/cychen2021/elfuzz:25.06.0`: Specifies the Docker image to use.

This will enter a shell into the container. Then, following the instructions in `/elfuzz/README.md` (which is a symlink to [docker_readme.md](docker_readme.md) in this repository) to replicate the experiments.

The Docker image has only been tested on X86-64 machines.

## How to build the Docker image

Before building the Docker image, you should `cd` to the root of the ELFuzz source code and put `elfuzz_baselines.tar.zst` (downloaded from Figshare) into `tmp/`.

The Docker image is built by the following command:

```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/cychen2021/elfuzz:25.06.0 -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile --target publish .
```

## Source code layout

First, I'm sorry that the codebase is messy. It is hard to keep it clean while rushing towards the paper deadline.

TODO

## Miscellaneous

- The Docker version we used is 28.2.2.
- There is a PDF (`misc/sibling_container.pdf`) in the data tarball (`elfuzz_data_<timestamp>.tar.zst`) downloaded from the Figshare repository. It is a persistent version of the Stack Overflow post referenced above, in case that the link to the post is broken in the future.

## Maintenance statements

**On Jun. 19, 2026.** I tried my best to preserve the environment in the Docker image, keeping the replication package usable for as long as possible. However, there may be some aspects that I have not considered. If you encounter any issues that prevent you from using the package, please open an issue or launch a pull request.
